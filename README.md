# Pure Matter
This project aims at providing a browser-based interface for some Philips air purifiers (mainly older generations, eg. AC2729). Its intention is also to eventually become compatible with [Matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_(standard)) standard.

**This project is in very early stage of development and may not provide any useful functionalities yet.**
